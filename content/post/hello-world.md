This is my new website, powered by Hugo and GitHub Pages and whatnot.

## What I Do

First off I'm a high school student, so I don't really do much besides school. I also have the opportunity to take college courses at the local junior college, so most of my school is from those courses. Outside of school, I try to work on personal projects such as Prayer-bot in my free time, which hasn't been much as I would've liked. I'm a current Boy Scout working towards my Eagle rank, which I should be more concerned about. 

## Why A Website?

Well, this is me trying to put myself out there for the world to see. I would like to share my experinces and thoughts about my personal projects like Prayer-bot. I might also talk about my personal life on here whether I feel like it or not (who's going to read it anways?).

## A Backstory

I'm an aspiring software developer. I've handled computers since I was 5 years old, making abstract art in MS Paint. From there, I start learning more about computers such as video games and websites. Naturally, I wanted to learn how to make those video games and websites. Thinking that making video games were more fun, I set my mind to learning how to do so. When I learned how difficult it really was, I quickly turned towards learning how to program in general, hoping that one day I will be able to make a game. While I was learning how to program, my dreams of making video games faded away. I set my eyes toward more realistic dreams such as making websites. So I watched from videos on XHTML from TheNewBoston (when he was still somewhat credible). From there, I learned more advanced topics such as Javascript, PHP, and even CSS. That led me to discovering other frameworks and creating web applictions. Now I'm intersted in the many ways of creating websites with Python, .NET, and Javscript. While I mainly focused on Javscript, I would like to expand into learning how to create applicable web applications.

## Some Goals

My ultimate goal is to be a data scientist. I find it fascinating to be able to manipulate and find patterns with just data. I find it hard to learn data science using resources just on the internet, so I hope that I will be able to learn data science by working my way up to a master's in Computer Science.
